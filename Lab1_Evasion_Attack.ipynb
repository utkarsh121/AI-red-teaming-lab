    "## 🎯 The Story\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you are a spammer. You want to send promotional messages to thousands of people, but there is a spam filter standing in your way — a machine learning model that has been trained to detect spam and block it before it reaches anyone's inbox.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal as an attacker is not to break the filter or hack into it. Instead, you want to **craft your spam message so cleverly that the filter does not recognize it as spam**, even though any human reading it clearly would.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called an **Evasion Attack**. You are evading detection by manipulating your input.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📖 What is an Evasion Attack?\n",
    "\n",
    "An evasion attack happens **after** a model has already been trained and deployed. The attacker does not touch the model or its training data. Instead, the attacker carefully modifies an input — just enough to fool the model — while keeping the input meaningful to a human.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real world examples:**\n",
    "- Tweaking spam emails to bypass spam filters\n",
    "- Modifying malware signatures slightly to bypass AI-based antivirus software\n",
    "- Altering network traffic patterns to evade AI intrusion detection systems\n",

    "2. Convert the text messages into numbers the model can understand\n",
    "3. Train a spam classifier — this is the model we will attack\n",
    "4. Test the classifier on clean messages to confirm it works\n",

This is a black-box evasion attack, meaning the attacker does not need to know anything about the model's internal structure — they only need to be able to send inputs and get predictions back. This is very realistic because in the real world, attackers usually cannot see inside the model they are attacking.\n",

    "**What HopSkipJump does:** It takes a spam message that the model correctly identifies as spam, and it makes tiny mathematical adjustments to the numerical representation of that message, repeatedly testing whether the model still calls it spam. It keeps adjusting until it finds a version that the model classifies as legitimate — while keeping the changes as small as possible.\n",
