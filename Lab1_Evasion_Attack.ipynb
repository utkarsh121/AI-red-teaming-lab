You want to send promotional messages to thousands of people, but there is a spam filter standing in your way — a machine learning model trained to detect spam and block it before it reaches anyone's inbox.\n\nYour goal as an attacker is not to break the filter or hack into it. Instead, you want to **craft your spam message so cleverly that the filter does not recognise it as spam**, even though any human reading it clearly would.\n\nThis is called an **Evasion Attack**. You are evading detection by manipulating your input.\n\n---\n\n## 📖 What is an Evasion Attack?\n\nAn evasion attack happens **after** a model has already been trained and deployed. The attacker does not touch the model or its training data. Instead, the attacker carefully modifies an input just enough to fool the model while keeping it meaningful to a human.\n\n**Real world examples:**\n- Tweaking spam emails to bypass spam filters\n- Modifying malware signatures slightly to bypass AI-based antivirus software\n- Altering network traffic patterns to evade AI intrusion detection systems\n\n---\n\n## 🗂️ What We Will Do in This Lab\n\n1. Load a real SMS spam dataset and explore it\n2. Convert text messages into numbers the model can understand\n3. Train a spam classifier — this is the model we will attack\n4. Confirm the classifier works before attacking it\n5. Use ART to perform an evasion attack\n6. Measure and reflect on the results\n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ Step 1: Import the Tools We Need"

Is that a good spam filter?\n- Why does the balance between spam and legitimate messages matter when training a model?\n\n---\n\n## 🔢 Step 3: Convert Text to Numbers\n\nMachine learning models cannot read text — they only understand numbers. We use **TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency)** to convert each message into a list of numbers.\n\nThe idea is simple: words that appear a lot in spam messages (like FREE, WIN, PRIZE) get high scores. Words that appear in almost every message (like the, a, is) get low scores because they are not useful for identifying spam."
