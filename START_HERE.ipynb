    "# 🔴 Welcome to the AI Red Team Lab\n",
    "### Certified AI Penetration Tester – Red Team (CAIPT-RT)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome, student. This lab environment is your hands-on workspace for learning how machine learning models can be attacked — and why understanding these attacks makes AI systems safer.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are going to play the role of an **attacker** (red team) in each lab. You will learn four real-world attack techniques that security researchers and AI penetration testers use to test the robustness of machine learning systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📚 What You Will Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "You will work through **four attack labs**, each targeting a different stage of a machine learning system's life:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Lab | Attack Type | Plain English Description |\n",
    "|-----|------------|---------------------------|\n",
    "| Lab 1 | **Evasion** | Trick a trained model by crafting sneaky inputs |\n",
    "| Lab 2 | **Poisoning** | Corrupt the training data before the model learns |\n",
    "| Lab 3 | **Inference** | Violate privacy by figuring out whose data trained the model |\n",
    "| Lab 4 | **Extraction** | Steal a model just by asking it questions |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 How These Labs Work\n",
    "\n",
    "Each lab notebook is **self-guiding**. You do not need prior machine learning experience. Every step is explained in plain English before any code appears.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout each lab you will see three types of prompts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 👀 **\"What do you see?\"** — asking you to observe and interpret output\n",
    "- 🧪 **\"Try this\"** — asking you to change something and observe what happens\n",
    "- 💭 **\"Think about it\"** — asking you to reflect on real-world implications\n",
    "\n",
    "These prompts are the most important part of the lab. Running code without thinking about what it means is not learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚠️ Important Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything you learn in this lab is for **defensive and educational purposes only**. Understanding how attacks work is the first step toward building systems that can defend against them.\n",
    "\n",
    "All attacks in this lab run **entirely on your local machine** against models you build yourself. No external systems are targeted.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🗂️ Your Lab Workspace\n",
    "\n",
    "Your lab environment has three folders:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`datasets/`** — contains the data files your models will learn from\n",
    "- **`notebooks/`** — contains these lab notebooks (you are here)\n",
    "- **`outputs/`** — save your results, screenshots, and answers here\n",
