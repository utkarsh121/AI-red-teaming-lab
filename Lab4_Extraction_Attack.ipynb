    "## 🎯 The Story\n",
    "\n",
    "A company has spent years and millions of dollars building a machine learning model that predicts whether families qualify for social services. The model is their competitive advantage. They protect it carefully — the model itself, the code, and the training data are all kept secret.\n",
    "\n",
    "But they do offer it as an API service. You send it an application, it sends back a decision. That is all you get — no code, no probabilities, just a label.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are an attacker — perhaps a competitor, perhaps a researcher exposing bias. You have no access to the model internals or the training data. But you do have access to the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "By sending thousands of carefully chosen queries and recording the responses, you can **build your own model that behaves almost identically** to the original — without ever seeing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a **Model Extraction Attack** — also called model stealing.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📖 What is a Model Extraction Attack?\n",
    "\n",
    "A model extraction attack allows an attacker to create a functional copy of a machine learning model by repeatedly querying it and using the query-response pairs as training data for a new model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is this a problem?**\n",
    "- The stolen model can be used to **steal intellectual property** — years of R&D reproduced for free\n",
    "- The stolen model can be used to **prepare better attacks** — once you have a local copy, you can run evasion and poisoning attacks against it much more effectively\n",
    "- The stolen model can be used to **probe for bias** — sometimes used by researchers to expose unfairness in proprietary models\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real world examples:**\n",
    "- Stealing a competitor's fraud detection model\n",
    "- Copying a medical diagnosis model to avoid licensing fees\n",
    "- Using a stolen model as a stepping stone for further attacks\n",
