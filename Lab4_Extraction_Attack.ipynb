   "source": "# 🔴 Lab 4 — Extraction Attack (Model Stealing)\n### Certified AI Penetration Tester – Red Team (CAIPT-RT)\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 The Story\n\nA company spent three years and significant budget building a machine learning model that predicts whether families qualify for social services. The model is their competitive advantage — it is more accurate than anything else on the market. The code, internal weights, and training data are all kept completely secret.\n\nBut they offer it as a paid API service. You send it an application profile, it sends back a decision. That is all you get — a prediction.\n\nYou are an attacker — perhaps a competitor, perhaps a researcher trying to expose bias in an opaque system. You have no access to the model internals whatsoever. But you have access to the API.\n\nBy sending thousands of carefully chosen queries and recording every response, you can **build your own model that makes almost identical decisions** to the original — without ever seeing the training data or the model code.\n\nThis is a **Model Extraction Attack** — also called model stealing.\n\n---\n\n## 📖 What is a Model Extraction Attack?\n\nThe attacker creates a functional copy of a model by repeatedly querying it and using the query-response pairs as their own training data.\n\n**The core idea:** Every time you ask the model a question and it answers, it is unknowingly teaching you how it thinks. Collect enough answers and you can train your own model to think the same way.\n\n**Why is this a problem?**\n- **Intellectual property theft** — years of R&D reproduced for free\n- **Enabling further attacks** — a stolen local copy can be attacked using white-box methods that require direct model access\n- **Exposing bias** — researchers sometimes use extraction to audit black-box models for fairness\n\n**Real world examples:**\n- Stealing a competitor's fraud detection model to avoid licensing fees\n- Copying a medical diagnosis model and rebranding it\n- Using a stolen model as a stepping stone to prepare evasion attacks (Lab 1)\n\n---\n\n## 🗂️ What We Will Do in This Lab\n\n1. Load the Nursery dataset and prepare it for modelling\n2. Train the victim model — the valuable proprietary model being stolen\n3. Set up a black-box query interface that simulates API access only\n4. Query the victim and collect its responses as stolen training data\n5. Train our own model on those responses and measure how close we got\n6. Compare results at different query budgets — more queries, better copy?\n7. Think like a defender — what signals would alert you to this attack?\n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ Step 1: Import the Tools We Need"

This time we split it into **three portions** rather than two, because we have three distinct roles to play:\n\n**Victim's training data** — the private data the victim model learns from. The attacker never sees this. In a real scenario this would be the company's proprietary dataset stored securely on their servers.\n\n**Attacker's query pool** — data the attacker uses to send queries to the victim's API. These are records the attacker has access to independently — they do not need to come from the victim's dataset. Any plausible input data will do.\n\n**Evaluation set** — held out completely and used only to measure the quality of both the victim and stolen models fairly. Neither model trained on this data.\n\nThis three-way split mirrors a real attack scenario where the attacker has their own data, the victim has their own private data, and we measure everything on neutral ground."

   "source": "### 👀 What Do You See?\n\nThe victim model gives back a **probability distribution** for each query — a list of numbers that sum to 1.0, one per class. The highest number is the predicted class.\n\n**Why do probabilities matter more than just the label?**\n\nIf the API only returned a label — say `class 2` — the attacker gets limited information. But if it returns `[0.01, 0.02, 0.94, 0.02, 0.01]`, the attacker knows the model is 94% confident it is class 2. That confidence information is extremely valuable for training a stolen model, because the stolen model can try to match not just which class was predicted, but *how sure* the victim was.\n\nThis is why the \"label-only\" defense is effective — returning just the class name strips out all the confidence information.\n\n---\n\n## 🔴 Step 3: Perform the Extraction Attack\n\nHere is exactly how model stealing works in this lab:\n\n**Phase 1 — Query the victim (information gathering)**\n\nThe attacker sends records from their query pool to the victim model's API. For each record, the victim returns a probability distribution. The attacker collects all these responses. They now have a dataset of (input, victim_prediction) pairs — a stolen dataset.\n\n**Phase 2 — Train a stolen model (replication)**\n\nThe attacker trains their own fresh model on this stolen dataset. Instead of the real labels (which they do not have), they use the victim's predictions as labels. The stolen model learns to reproduce the victim's decision-making.\n\n**The key insight:** The victim model is being used as an expensive labelling service, entirely against its owner's intentions.\n\n**We test three query budgets** — 100, 500, and 2000 queries — to show how the quality of the stolen model improves as more information is gathered."

This tells you how useful the stolen model is on its own.\n\n**Agreement** measures how closely the stolen model mimics the victim — even when the victim is wrong, does the stolen model make the same mistake? High agreement means the attacker successfully replicated the victim's decision-making, not just its correctness.\n\n**Notice the diminishing returns:** The jump from 100 to 500 queries likely gives a bigger improvement than the jump from 500 to 2000. Why? Because the first few hundred queries cover the main patterns in the data. Additional queries reveal increasingly rare edge cases that have smaller and smaller marginal value. This is a fundamental property of learning from data.\n\n**Also notice:** The stolen model uses LogisticRegression, not Random Forest like the victim.

The tools and techniques you used in this lab are the same ones used by researchers at IBM, Microsoft, Google, and security firms worldwide.\n\nThe Adversarial Robustness Toolbox (ART) that powered these labs is open source and actively maintained — it is the same library used to evaluate AI systems in production environments.\n\nReturn to [START_HERE.ipynb](START_HERE.ipynb) to review all four labs.\n\n---\n*Built with the Adversarial Robustness Toolbox (ART) — https://github.com/Trusted-AI/adversarial-robustness-toolbox*"
