The model is their competitive advantage. The code, weights, and training data are all kept secret.\n\nBut they offer it as an API service. You send it an application, it sends back a decision. That is all you get.\n\nYou are an attacker — perhaps a competitor, perhaps a researcher exposing bias. You have no access to the model internals. But you have access to the API.\n\nBy sending thousands of carefully chosen queries and recording the responses, you can **build your own model that behaves almost identically** to the original.\n\nThis is a **Model Extraction Attack** — also called model stealing.\n\n---\n\n## 📖 What is a Model Extraction Attack?\n\nThe attacker creates a functional copy of a model by repeatedly querying it and using the query-response pairs as training data for a new model.\n\n**Why is this a problem?**\n- Stolen intellectual property — years of R&D reproduced for free\n- The stolen model can be used to prepare better evasion attacks locally\n- Researchers sometimes use it to expose bias in proprietary models\n\n**Real world examples:**\n- Stealing a competitor's fraud detection model\n- Copying a medical diagnosis model to avoid licensing fees\n- Using a stolen model as a stepping stone for further attacks\n\n---\n\n## 🗂️ What We Will Do in This Lab\n\n1. Train the victim model — the valuable model being stolen\n2. Set up a black-box query interface simulating API access\n3. Use ART's extraction attack to steal the model\n4. Compare stolen model quality at different query volumes\n5. Think like a defender\n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ Step 1: Import the Tools We Need"
