   "source": "# 🔴 Lab 2 — Poisoning Attack\n### Certified AI Penetration Tester – Red Team (CAIPT-RT)\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 The Story\n\nA company is building a spam filter. The training dataset is stored in a shared folder that multiple people can access during data collection. You are an attacker who has quietly slipped corrupted examples into that folder before training begins. When the model trains on your poisoned data, it learns the wrong lessons — and you have permanently damaged it without ever touching the model's code.\n\nThis is a **Poisoning Attack**. You corrupt the data the model learns from.\n\n---\n\n## 📖 What is a Poisoning Attack?\n\nA poisoning attack targets the **training phase** — before the model learns. The attacker injects bad examples into the training dataset.\n\n**Two main types:**\n- **Label poisoning** — changing labels of real examples (relabeling spam as legitimate)\n- **Data poisoning** — injecting entirely fake examples to push the model in a harmful direction\n\n**Real world examples:**\n- Corrupting training data for a fraud detection model so it misses certain patterns\n- Poisoning a medical diagnosis model to misclassify certain conditions\n- Poisoning a content moderation model to allow harmful content through\n\n---\n\n## 🗂️ What We Will Do in This Lab\n\n1. Load the SMS spam dataset and train a clean baseline model\n2. Record the clean model's accuracy as our benchmark\n3. Inject poisoned examples at different rates\n4. Retrain on poisoned data and compare accuracy\n5. Visualise the damage\n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ Step 1: Import the Tools We Need"
