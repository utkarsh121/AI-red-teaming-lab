    "\n",
    "## 🎯 The Story\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you work at a company that is building a spam filter. The filter is trained on a large dataset of labeled messages. That dataset is stored in a shared folder that multiple people have access to during the data collection phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are an attacker who has managed to get access to that shared folder **before training begins**. You do not need to touch the model itself — instead, you quietly slip corrupted examples into the training data. When the model trains on your poisoned data, it learns the wrong lessons — and you have permanently damaged it without ever touching the model's code.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a **Poisoning Attack**. You corrupt the data the model learns from.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📖 What is a Poisoning Attack?\n",
    "\n",
    "A poisoning attack targets the **training phase** of a machine learning model — before or during the time the model is learning. The attacker injects carefully crafted bad examples into the training dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Label poisoning** — the attacker changes the labels of real examples. For instance, relabeling spam messages as legitimate so the model learns that spam is acceptable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data poisoning** — the attacker injects entirely fake examples designed to push the model's decision boundary in a harmful direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real world examples:**\n",
    "- Corrupting training data for a fraud detection model so it misses certain fraud patterns\n",
    "- Poisoning a medical diagnosis model to misclassify certain conditions\n",
    "- Poisoning a content moderation model to allow harmful content through\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🗂️ What We Will Do in This Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load the SMS spam dataset and train a clean baseline model\n",
    "2. Record the clean model's accuracy — this is our benchmark\n",
    "3. Inject poisoned examples into the training data\n",
    "4. Retrain the model on the poisoned data\n",
    "5. Compare accuracy before and after poisoning\n",
    "6. Experiment with different poisoning rates\n",
