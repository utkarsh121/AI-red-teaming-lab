    "## 🎯 The Story\n",
    "\n",
    "A hospital has trained a machine learning model to predict which patients are at risk of a certain disease. The model was trained on real patient records — sensitive data including age, family background, financial situation, and health history.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hospital never releases the patient records themselves. But they do offer the trained model as a public-facing tool: doctors and researchers can send it a patient profile and get a risk prediction back.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are an attacker. You do not have the patient records. But you have access to the model. Can you figure out **whether a specific person's data was used to train the model?**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you can, you have just violated that person's privacy — you know they were a patient at this hospital and their data was part of a sensitive medical study.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a **Membership Inference Attack**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📖 What is a Membership Inference Attack?\n",
    "\n",
    "A membership inference attack tries to determine whether a specific data point was part of a model's training dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why does this work?** Machine learning models tend to behave slightly differently on data they have seen during training versus data they have never seen. Specifically, models tend to be more confident and make fewer errors on their training data. An attacker can exploit this difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Two approaches used in this lab:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rule-based attack** — simple rule: if the model predicts correctly on a sample, assume it was in the training set. If it predicts incorrectly, assume it was not.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Black-box attack** — trains a separate \"attack model\" that learns to distinguish between training members and non-members based on the victim model's output probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real world examples:**\n",
    "- Determining if a specific person's medical record was in a clinical trial dataset\n",
    "- Confirming if a person's financial data was used to train a credit scoring model\n",
    "- Violating GDPR/HIPAA by inferring membership in sensitive datasets\n",
