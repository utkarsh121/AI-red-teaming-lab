They never release the records themselves, but they do offer the trained model as a public tool: send it a patient profile, get a risk prediction back.\n\nYou are an attacker. You do not have the patient records. But you have access to the model. Can you figure out **whether a specific person's data was used to train it?**\n\nIf you can, you have violated that person's privacy — you now know they were a patient at this hospital and their data was part of a sensitive medical study.\n\nThis is a **Membership Inference Attack**.\n\n---\n\n## 📖 What is a Membership Inference Attack?\n\nIt tries to determine whether a specific data point was part of a model's training dataset.\n\n**Why does this work?** Models tend to behave slightly differently on data they trained on versus data they have never seen. They are more confident and make fewer errors on training data. An attacker exploits this difference.\n\n**Real world examples:**\n- Determining if a specific person's medical record was in a clinical trial dataset\n- Confirming if someone's financial data trained a credit scoring model\n- Violating GDPR or HIPAA by inferring membership in sensitive datasets\n\n---\n\n## 🗂️ What We Will Do in This Lab\n\n1. Load the Nursery dataset and understand what it contains\n2. Train a classifier and observe the train vs test accuracy gap\n3. Run a rule-based membership inference attack\n4. Run ART's black-box membership inference attack\n5. Understand why overfitting makes models leak privacy\n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ Step 1: Import the Tools We Need"
