The hospital never releases the records themselves, but they do offer the trained model as a public tool: you send it a patient profile, it sends back a risk prediction.\n\nYou are an attacker. You do not have the patient records. But you have access to the model. Can you figure out **whether a specific person's data was used to train it?**\n\nIf you can, you have violated that person's privacy — you now know they were a patient at this hospital and their data was part of a sensitive medical study. That is a real legal and ethical violation even if you never saw the actual record.\n\nThis is called a **Membership Inference Attack**.\n\n---\n\n## 📖 What is a Membership Inference Attack?\n\nIt tries to determine whether a specific data point was part of a model's training dataset.\n\nThink of it this way: imagine a chef who memorised certain recipes by cooking them over and over. If you asked that chef to recreate a dish, they would do it much more accurately for dishes they personally practised than for dishes they only vaguely know. A smart observer could figure out which dishes the chef trained on just by watching how confident they are.\n\nMachine learning models behave the same way. They tend to be **more confident and make fewer mistakes on data they trained on** compared to data they have never seen. An attacker exploits this subtle difference.\n\n**Real world examples:**\n- Determining if a specific person's medical record was in a clinical trial dataset\n- Confirming if someone's financial data trained a credit scoring model\n- Violating GDPR or HIPAA by inferring membership in sensitive datasets\n\n---\n\n## 🗂️ What We Will Do in This Lab\n\n1. Load the Nursery dataset — a realistic dataset of private family records\n2. Prepare and encode the data so the model can understand it\n3. Train a classifier and measure the gap between training and test performance\n4. Run a simple rule-based membership inference attack\n5. Run a more sophisticated black-box attack that trains its own attack model\n6. Understand why the gap between training and test accuracy is the root cause\n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ Step 1: Import the Tools We Need"

It was originally created to rank applications for nursery school enrollment in the 1980s in Ljubljana, Slovenia.\n\nEach row in this dataset represents a **family application**. The columns capture private information about each family — their financial situation, housing conditions, number of children, health status, and social circumstances.\n\nFor our attack scenario, imagine each row is a patient record at a hospital, and the model was trained on these records to make enrollment or eligibility decisions. The records are private. The model is public.\n\n**Why this dataset?** Because it has real categorical structure (words, not just numbers), multiple classes to predict, and enough rows (nearly 13,000) to make a realistic attack experiment."

Each column is a piece of private information about them.\n- The `target` column is what the model learned to predict — the enrollment decision.\n- Notice that most applications were marked `not_recom` (not recommended). This imbalance matters — a model that just always guesses `not_recom` would be very accurate but completely useless.\n\n**Think about this:** In a real hospital scenario, each of these rows might be a patient. The `target` might be a diagnosis. If an attacker could determine that a specific person's row was in this dataset, they would know that person received medical care at this institution — which is private information.\n\n---\n\n## 🔢 Step 3: Convert Text to Numbers (Encoding)\n\nMachine learning models cannot read words. They only understand numbers. Every piece of text in this dataset must be converted into a number before training can begin.\n\nWe use a technique called **Label Encoding**. It assigns a unique integer to each unique text value in a column. For example:\n\n- `finance` column: `convenient` → 0, `inconv` → 1\n- `health` column: `not_recom` → 0, `priority` → 1, `recommended` → 2\n\nThis is purely a technical translation — it does not change the meaning of the data, it just puts it in a form the model can do mathematics with.\n\n**Important:** After encoding, `X` is the input data (the 8 feature columns) and `y` is the target (the enrollment decision we want to predict)."

In our attack scenario, we call these the **members**. These are the private records that went into the model.\n\n**Test set** — records the model has never seen during training. We call these the **non-members**. The model has no memory of these at all.\n\nThe whole point of a membership inference attack is to figure out which group a given record belongs to — **without ever seeing the split directly**. We only have the model and the ability to query it.\n\n**Why `stratify=y`?** This ensures that the same proportion of each target class appears in both the training and test sets. Without this, by pure chance you might end up with all the rare `very_recom` records landing in training and none in the test set, which would make the split unrepresentative."

   "source": "---\n\n## 🏋️ Step 5: Train the Target Model\n\nWe train a **Random Forest** classifier. A Random Forest is an ensemble model — it builds many individual decision trees and combines their votes into a final prediction.\n\n**What is a decision tree?** Imagine a flowchart of yes/no questions: \"Is the family's finance status convenient? If yes, go left. If no, go right.\" Each question narrows down which enrollment category the family likely belongs to.\n\n**Why a forest instead of one tree?** One tree can memorise the training data very specifically and make poor predictions on new data. Having hundreds of trees each trained on slightly different samples, then voting on the answer, produces a much more reliable result. This is the same principle as asking 100 experts instead of 1.\n\n**The parameter `n_estimators=100`** means we build 100 trees. More trees generally means better accuracy but slower training.\n\n**The critical thing to watch:** After training, we measure accuracy on both the training set and the test set. The difference between these two numbers is what makes membership inference possible."

   "source": "### 👀 What Do You See?\n\nThe model performs better on training data (members) than on test data (non-members). This is called **overfitting** — the model has partially memorised its training examples rather than just learning general patterns.\n\n**Why does overfitting enable attacks?**\n\nThink of it like a student who memorised last year's exam answers word for word. Ask them a question from last year's exam and they answer instantly with high confidence. Ask them a new question on the same topic and they are less sure. A smart observer watching this student could figure out which questions came from the old exam just by watching their confidence level.\n\nThe model behaves the same way:\n- Member record → model predicts with high confidence → likely correct\n- Non-member record → model is slightly less sure → slightly more likely to be wrong\n\nThe attack exploits this signal.\n\n**The larger the gap, the easier the attack.** A perfectly generalising model with zero gap would give the attacker nothing to work with.\n\n---\n\n## 🔴 Step 6: Rule-Based Membership Inference Attack\n\nThe first attack is beautifully simple. It uses just one rule:\n\n> **If the model predicts the correct label for a record → guess it is a member.**\n> **If the model predicts incorrectly → guess it is a non-member.**\n\nThis works because models are more accurate on data they trained on. It is not a perfect attack — the model does sometimes get non-member records right too — but it performs better than random guessing, which is the baseline we care about.\n\n**Why is 50% the baseline?** Because random guessing on a binary question (member vs non-member) gives 50% accuracy by definition. Any attack that scores above 50% is learning something real about the model's behaviour. Even 55% accuracy is a privacy violation in a sensitive context — it means the attacker is gaining real information."

   "source": "### 👀 What Do You See?\n\n- **Random guessing gives 50%.** Any score above this means the attack is learning real information.\n- Even a small advantage — say 55% or 60% — is meaningful in privacy terms. If someone's medical record was in a hospital's AI training set, you now have better-than-chance odds of knowing that.\n- The rule-based attack is simple and fast but limited. It only uses whether the prediction was right or wrong — it ignores *how* confident the model was.\n\n### 🧪 Try This\n\nAfter running the rule-based attack, think about this: what if the model was equally accurate on members and non-members? The rule would not work at all. This is why privacy researchers recommend training models that generalise well — the attack surface shrinks as the accuracy gap shrinks.\n\n---\n\n## 🔴 Step 7: Black-Box Membership Inference Attack\n\nThe second attack is more sophisticated. Instead of a simple rule, it **trains its own small model** — called the attack model — to distinguish members from non-members.\n\n**How does it work?**\n\nThe key insight is that when a model predicts on a record, it does not just output one label — it outputs a **probability distribution** across all possible classes. For example: `[0.02, 0.01, 0.91, 0.03, 0.03]`. This says the model is 91% confident the record belongs to class 2.\n\nMembers tend to get **higher confidence scores** on their true class. Non-members tend to get more spread-out, uncertain distributions. The attack model learns to tell these two patterns apart.\n\n**This is called a black-box attack** because the attacker never sees inside the victim model — no code, no weights, no training data. They only see inputs and outputs, exactly as if they were calling a real API.\n\n**The attack model is trained in two phases:**\n1. Query the victim model on known members and known non-members to collect (confidence, true label) pairs\n2. Train a small classifier to predict member/non-member from those confidence patterns\n\nThe attacker then uses this trained attack model to classify unknown records."

   "source": "### 👀 What Do You See?\n\n- The black-box attack uses richer information — the full probability distribution — rather than just whether the prediction was right or wrong. This usually produces a better result.\n- Compare the two attacks. How much did the extra sophistication help?\n\n**On confidence distributions — why do they leak membership?**\n\nWhen a model trains on a record it tends to push its confidence for the correct class very high — sometimes to 0.95 or 0.99. On a non-member record it has never seen, the confidence is more spread out. Even a small systematic difference across many records is enough for the attack model to learn the pattern.\n\n### 🧪 Try This\n\nGo back to the model training step and change `n_estimators=100` to `n_estimators=500`. Retrain and rerun the attacks.\n\n- Does a more powerful model with less overfitting become harder to attack?\n- What does this tell you about the relationship between model quality and privacy risk?\n\n---\n\n## 💭 Step 8: Reflect on What You Have Learned"
